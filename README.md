# Raspberry Pi Database project

TODO:
- [ ] refer to Readme best practices
- [ ] rewrite in imperative language

Connect to a Raspberry Pi over SSH, migrate the Chinook database from SQLite to PostgreSQL, and slice and dice your data.
## Project overview
This project originated as prep for a job interview. The first iteration failed. Fast forward 7 months, and I am reviving the project. Read more in the jupyter notebook TODO: insert github link here.
